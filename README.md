# Multi-Class Classification with PyTorch 🧠🔥

This repository contains a multi-class classification project built using **PyTorch**. The model was trained on a synthetic dataset generated using **`make_blobs`**, achieving an impressive **99.5% accuracy**! 🎯

## 🚀 Features:
- **Dataset:** Generated using `make_blobs` for clear class separation.
- **Model Architecture:** Implemented a neural network using **PyTorch**.
- **Training:** Used **CrossEntropyLoss** and **Adam optimizer** for efficient learning.
- **Decision Boundaries:** Visualized decision regions for both train and test sets.

## 📷 Visualization:
The repository includes **decision boundary plots** that show how well the model classifies different regions.


## 🔧 Setup & Usage:

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/multi-class-pytorch.git
